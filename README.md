# Tasks

1) You have a 10 tiles each with different numbers on them ‐ 1, 2, 3, ..., 10. The tiles are all face up on a table. Write down the steps you'd take to sort them into an ordered list of numbers.

2) Using the same tiles as before, they are in a row: 3, 5, 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 8, 4, 6. If you could only swap the position of two adjacent tiles at a time, write down the steps to improve the sorting of the tiles towards 1, 2, 3, ..., 10. Only do this if different from your answer to 1)

3) You're given this list of words: "Hello", "World", "Frame". Discuss the steps or code
needed to print out this:
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* Frame *
*********

Add "The" to the list in 3. and print out The Hello World Frame as above.

4) Write out the steps (or small program if you'd prefer) to go through the numbers 1‐
20 and print out all the numbers that are a multiple of 3 or 4 (3, 4, 6, 8, ...)
