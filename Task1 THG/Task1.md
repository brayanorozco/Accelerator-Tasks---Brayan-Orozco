# Task number 1

### 1) You have a 10 tiles each with different numbers on them ‚Äê 1, 2, 3 (...) 10. The tiles are all face up on a table. Write down the steps you'd take to sort them into an ordered list of numbers.


For this task, I used 3 different alternatives: do/while, for, and sort.

Basically, in the three blocks of code, the array is traversed to make a comparison of 2 numbers stored in an initial position, and the next one in the array. This way, if the starting number is higher, they will swap places. These comparisons are made as the loop progresses through the list.
