### Write out the steps (or small program if you'd prefer) to go through the numbers 1‚Äê 20 and print out all the numbers that are a multiple of 3 or 4 (3, 4, 6, 8, ...)

When you divide a multiple by its multiplicand, the remainder of this division is 0.

So after going through the array and identifying the remainder of the numbers in the list, all that remains is to store the numbers that meet this condition in a new array.
